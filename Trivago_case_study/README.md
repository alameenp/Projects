### 1. Session investigation
In dropbox, you will find some information about user visits to our site, stored as a csv. Take
a look at this data using the tools of your choice. You can find some basic information about
the columns in the data structure pdf.

First, we would like you to perform some descriptive analysis. What can you tell us about the
sessions that are included? Imagine that you want to understand the users of our product
and think about what would be important for you. Explore the data, get a feel for how it is
structured and show us what you can do.

Secondly we want you to explore certain KPIs. One of our core KPIs is the clickout
ratio (COR) defined as the sum of clickouts divided by the sum of sessions:
• Calculate the clickout ratio per platform and device type - what platform has the
highest COR? What device has the lowest COR? Are there differences by traffic
type? Can you draw any conclusions from the ratios about the coded values for traffic
type?
• Can you think of an additional two KPIs? Please provide KPI definitions and charts or
tables showing the development over time along with descriptions and critical
analysis of what you see.

Describe what you see and try to think about why these developments might be happening.
Expected output is a PDF or notebook with the following:
• Report on the data provided, illustrated with visualisations of data.
• Study on clickout ratio.
• KPI definition and chart or table showing the development over time along with
descriptions and critical analysis of what you see. Are there any recommendations
you can give the product teams?

If you are unsure of the validity of any created KPIs due to low amounts of data, please
explain the method in measuring them.

### 2. User actions
For the users in the first task, we have extracted a list of actions. Take a look at the data and
get familiar with the structure. Each row corresponds to a logged event and you can find
basic information on the structure in the pdf. Explore the data and do some investigation into
the user actions.
• Explore how sessions start at trivago and think about how this might correspond to
our website.
• Look at the last actions of sessions and find the drop rate for different actions.
• Now think about conversions on our site. What actions might we consider as
conversions? Can you determine from your analysis of the data which numbers refer
to these actions? Look into sessions with conversions that you have determined and
see if there are any actions that correspond to higher numbers of conversions.
