# Rotation Curve Analysis in ESO138-G014 Galaxy

## Overview
Verified the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) hypothesis in the ESO138-G014 galaxy using luminous and hydrogen density data from open-source astronomical databases.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Regression & Numerical Methods

## Key Highlights
- Developed galaxy rotation curve models using 10,000+ data points.
- Applied regression, numerical methods, and differential equations to estimate mass distribution.
- Results aligned with the MOND formula.

## Data Source
Open-source astronomical databases for galaxy luminous and hydrogen density data.
